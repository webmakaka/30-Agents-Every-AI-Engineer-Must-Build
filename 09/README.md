# Chapter 10: Conversational and Content Creation Agents

**Book:** *30 Agents Every AI Engineer Must Build* by Imran Ahmad (Packt Publishing, 2026)

---

## Overview

This repository is the executable companion to **Chapter 10** of *30 Agents Every AI Engineer Must Build*. It examines two agent architectures that operate at the boundary between algorithmic capability and human experience: the Empathetic Mental Health Support Agent (dual-memory hierarchy with SafetyLayer sentinel and PersonaEngine constraint layer) and the Marketing Content Assistant (multi-agent SMPA pipeline with specialist agents, CSP-based brand enforcement via EditorAgent, and adaptive feedback via AnalyticsEngine).

Every code cell runs **without an API key** in Simulation Mode, powered by a `MockLLM` and `MockEmbeddings` replace the LLM client transparently (works identically across all providers). When an API key is provided (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google) or Ollama is running locally, the notebook seamlessly switches to Live Mode. Each provider has its own pre-executed notebook variant.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build.git
cd ./30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build/
cd chapter10

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then add your provider's dependencies:
pip install -r requirements-openai.txt    # For OpenAI GPT-4o
pip install -r requirements-claude.txt    # For Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4
pip install -r requirements-gemini.txt    # For Google Gemini Flash 2.5
pip install -r requirements-ollama.txt    # For local Ollama (DeepSeek V2)

# 4. (Optional) Configure your LLM provider for Live Mode
cp .env.template .env
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or GOOGLE_API_KEY — or use Ollama locally

# 5. Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook Chapter_10_Conversational_and_Content_Creation_Agents.ipynb
```

| **3.4** | §10.2 — Editor Agent | Quality control layer with consistency scoring |
| **3.5** | §10.2 — Multimodal Orchestration | `AssetRequest` + `dispatch_asset_request()` |
| **3.6** | §10.2 — Adaptive Optimization | `AnalyticsEngine` with CTR-based feedback |
| **3.7–3.9** | §10.2 — Campaign Demo | End-to-end campaign walkthrough with DataVault Pro brief |
| **4** | Summary | Key takeaways and pointer to Chapter 11 |

## Real-World Use Case: VaultPay Fintech

How does a fintech startup use these three agent architectures to ship faster, pass PCI DSS audits, and fix a declining support chatbot? The companion case study follows **VaultPay** — a payment processing platform facing a September audit deadline — through test-driven code generation, automated compliance scanning that catches card-number logging before it reaches production, and a self-improving support bot.

Read the full case study: **[USECASE.md](USECASE.md)** — includes the specific PCI violations caught, the self-improvement loop metrics, and projected revenue impact.

## Simulation Mode

When no API key is detected, the notebook activates **Simulation Mode**:

- `MockLLM` replaces the LLM client transparently (works identically across all providers)
- `MockOpenAIEmbeddings` provides deterministic 256-dimensional hash-based embeddings for reproducible FAISS behavior
- Context-aware mock responses cover both case studies
- Every cell executes successfully with no external dependencies

API key detection follows a three-tier cascade: `.env` file → environment variable → interactive prompt → Simulation Mode.

## Pre-Executed Notebook Variants

Every notebook is pre-executed with outputs saved. Pick the variant that matches your setup:

| Notebook | Provider | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION.ipynb](ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION.ipynb) | Simulation | No API key — MockLLM responses |
| [ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_OPENAI_GPT4o.ipynb](ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_OPENAI_GPT4o.ipynb) | OpenAI GPT-4o | Live LLM via `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| [ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_CLAUDE_Sonnet4.ipynb](ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_CLAUDE_Sonnet4.ipynb) | Claude Sonnet 4 | Live LLM via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| [ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_GEMINI_Flash25.ipynb](ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_GEMINI_Flash25.ipynb) | Gemini Flash 2.5 | Live LLM via `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| [ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B.ipynb](ch09_software_dev_agents__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B.ipynb) | Local Ollama | DeepSeek V2 16B — no API key |

All variants produce equivalent output. Compare them to see how different providers handle the same agent tasks.

For local LLM setup instructions (Ollama + DeepSeek on Windows, macOS, and Linux), see **[LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md](LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md)**.

For a detailed comparison of how each provider performs on this chapter's tasks — including Bloom's taxonomy ratings, strengths/weaknesses, and per-dimension scores — see **[LLM_COMPARISON.md](LLM_COMPARISON.md)**.

## Resilience Architecture

All agent operations are wrapped in the `@fail_gracefully` decorator:

- **On success:** `[INFO]` (blue) → `[SUCCESS]` (green)
- **On failure:** `[INFO]` (blue) → `[HANDLED ERROR]` (red) → fallback value returned
- **Guarantee:** No cell in the notebook will ever raise an unhandled exception

Key architectural patterns include Dual-Memory Hierarchy, Safety-First Pipeline, Persona as Constraint, CSP Brand Enforcement, and the SMPA Cycle.

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.10+ (recommended: 3.11 or 3.12)
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt` (base) and `requirements-<provider>.txt` for your LLM provider
- **API Key:** Optional — any of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local Ollama. Simulation Mode works without any.

## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for solutions to common dependency conflicts and runtime issues.
