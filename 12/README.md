# Chapter 12: Ethical and Explainable Agents

**Book:** *30 Agents Every AI Engineer Must Build* by Imran Ahmad (Packt Publishing, 2026)

---

## Overview

This repository is the executable companion to **Chapter 12** of *30 Agents Every AI Engineer Must Build*. It builds two complementary agent architectures: the Ethical Reasoning Agent (value alignment, deontic logic constraints, bias detection and mitigation with a three-layer fairness architecture, and EU AI Act compliance) and the Explainable Agent (structured explanation frameworks using LIME, SHAP, and counterfactual analysis with audience-adapted output and calibrated confidence communication). Case studies include a Fair HR Assistant and a Medical Diagnosis Assistant.

Every code cell runs **without an API key** in Simulation Mode, powered by a `MockLLM` engine that returns chapter-derived responses. When an API key is provided (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google) or Ollama is running locally, the notebooks seamlessly switch to Live Mode. Each provider has its own pre-executed notebook variant.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build.git
cd ./30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build/
cd chapter12

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then add your provider's dependencies:
pip install -r requirements-openai.txt    # For OpenAI GPT-4o
pip install -r requirements-claude.txt    # For Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4
pip install -r requirements-gemini.txt    # For Google Gemini Flash 2.5
pip install -r requirements-ollama.txt    # For local Ollama (DeepSeek V2)

# 4. (Optional) Configure your LLM provider for Live Mode
cp .env.template .env
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or GOOGLE_API_KEY — or use Ollama locally

# 5. Launch the notebooks
jupyter notebook 01_ethical_reasoning_agent.ipynb
jupyter notebook 02_explainable_agent.ipynb
```

## Section Map

This chapter uses **two notebooks** that mirror the chapter's two major sections:

### Notebook 1: Ethical Reasoning Agent

| Cell Group | Chapter Section | Concept Demonstrated |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Setup | Imports, API key detection, mode selection |
| **1** | §12.1 — Deontic Logic | Obligation, permission, prohibition operators with three axioms |
| **2** | §12.1 — Ethical Consistency | Formal permissibility criterion for agent actions |
| **3** | §12.2 — IEEE Ethically Aligned Design | Modular validators for human rights, well-being, accountability |
| **4** | §12.3 — EU AI Act Compliance | Seven-requirement compliance control plane |
| **5** | §12.4 — Impossibility Theorem | Statistical parity, equal opportunity, predictive parity constraints |
| **6** | §12.5 — Bias Detection Pipeline | Demographic parity, disparate impact with four-fifths rule |
| **7** | Case Study | FairHiringAgent HR Assistant with three-layer fairness architecture |

### Notebook 2: Explainable Agent

| Cell Group | Chapter Section | Concept Demonstrated |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Setup | Imports, API key detection, mode selection |
| **1** | §12.6 — Reasoning Transparency | Structured explanation frameworks |
| **2** | §12.7 — LIME and SHAP | Local and global model-agnostic explanations |
| **3** | §12.8 — Counterfactual Analysis | Minimal change explanations for recourse generation |
| **4** | §12.9 — Confidence Calibration | Epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty with temperature scaling |
| **5** | §12.10 — Audience Adaptation | Clinician vs. patient explanation templates |
| **6** | Case Study | DiagnosticAssistant medical case study with multi-source evidence |

## Real-World Use Cases

This chapter's code addresses two high-stakes domains where ethical AI and explainability are not optional — they're regulatory requirements.

**TalentForward** — An HR tech company discovers their resume screening algorithm has a disparate impact ratio of 0.73 (below the legal 0.80 threshold). The case study shows how the three-layer FairHiringAgent detects and mitigates gender bias while maintaining an auditable trail for their Fortune 500 client's legal team.

**ClearPath Health** — A clinical decision support startup finds that doctors ignore their 87% confidence predictions because there's no explanation behind the number. The case study shows how SHAP attribution, counterfactual analysis, and audience-adapted explanations raise physician engagement from 12% to 47%.

Read the full case study: **[USECASE.md](USECASE.md)** — includes both scenarios with stakeholder profiles, fairness metrics, and revenue impact.

## Simulation Mode

When no API key is detected, the notebooks activate **Simulation Mode**:

- All LLM calls are routed to `MockLLM`, returning chapter-derived responses
- Synthetic datasets are generated deterministically (seed=42)
- All fairness metrics, SHAP values, and explanations match the chapter examples
- Every cell executes successfully with no external dependencies

API key detection follows a three-tier cascade: `.env` file → environment variable → interactive prompt → Simulation Mode.

## Pre-Executed Notebook Variants

Every notebook is pre-executed with outputs saved. Pick the variant that matches your setup:

| Notebook | Provider | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [ch12_02_explainable_agent__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION.ipynb](ch12_02_explainable_agent__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION.ipynb) | Simulation | No API key — MockLLM responses |
| [ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_OPENAI_GPT4o.ipynb](ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_OPENAI_GPT4o.ipynb) | OpenAI GPT-4o | Live LLM via `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| [ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_CLAUDE_Sonnet4.ipynb](ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_CLAUDE_Sonnet4.ipynb) | Claude Sonnet 4 | Live LLM via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| [ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_GEMINI_Flash25.ipynb](ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_GEMINI_Flash25.ipynb) | Gemini Flash 2.5 | Live LLM via `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| [ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B.ipynb](ch12_01_ethical_reasoning_agent__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B.ipynb) | Local Ollama | DeepSeek V2 16B — no API key |

All variants produce equivalent output. Compare them to see how different providers handle the same agent tasks.

For local LLM setup instructions (Ollama + DeepSeek on Windows, macOS, and Linux), see **[LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md](LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md)**.

For a detailed comparison of how each provider performs on this chapter's tasks — including Bloom's taxonomy ratings, strengths/weaknesses, and per-dimension scores — see **[LLM_COMPARISON.md](LLM_COMPARISON.md)**.

## Resilience Architecture

All agent operations are wrapped in the `@graceful_fallback` decorator:

- **On success:** `[INFO]` (blue) → `[SUCCESS]` (green)
- **On failure:** `[INFO]` (blue) → `[HANDLED ERROR]` (red) → fallback value returned
- **Guarantee:** No cell in either notebook will ever raise an unhandled exception

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.10+ (recommended: 3.11 or 3.12)
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt` (base) and `requirements-<provider>.txt` for your LLM provider
- **API Key:** Optional — any of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local Ollama. Simulation Mode works without any.
