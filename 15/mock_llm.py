    """Simulation-mode LLM that returns pre-authored, section-mapped responses.

    Design Philosophy (Strategy §6):
        This is a context-aware response registry, not a random text generator.
        Each response is mapped to a specific chapter section, educationally
        accurate, and structurally realistic. Prompt classification uses
        keyword matching against the first two keywords in each rule.

    Registry Keys (9 total):
        feedback_generator   — pp. 22–24  Pedagogical feedback with nudge
        misconception_detect — pp. 22, 24 JSON misconception diagnosis
        propose_pedagogy     — pp. 27–28  Process-oriented rubric proposal
        propose_domain       — pp. 27–28  Technical rigor rubric proposal
        propose_assessment   — pp. 27–28  Binary reliability rubric proposal

            "### Novel Diagnostic-Trace Criterion\n\n"
            "By examining the strongest elements from competing proposals, "
            "a new criterion has emerged that none of the individual agents "
            "proposed independently.\n\n"
            "**Proposed Criterion: Diagnostic Trace Reasoning**\n\n"
            "This criterion combines the Domain Expert's emphasis on "
            "edge-case coverage with the Pedagogy Agent's process-oriented "
            "philosophy. Instead of simply checking whether edge cases "
            "pass, the criterion asks students to provide a written trace "
            "for one failing test case, demonstrating their ability to "
            "diagnose and reason about boundary behavior.\n\n"
            "**Scoring (3-point scale):**\n"
            "- Absent (0): No trace provided\n"
            "- Partial (1): Trace is provided but contains logical errors "
            "or skips steps\n"
            "- Complete (2): Trace correctly walks through the algorithm "
            "step-by-step for the edge case, identifying the exact point "
            "where special handling is needed\n\n"
            "**Why this is emergent:** The Domain Expert would not have "
            "proposed this because their framework focuses on output "
            "correctness, not process artifacts. The Pedagogy Agent would "
            "not have proposed this because their notion of 'strategy' was "
            "general, not tied to specific test cases. The combination of "
            "'trace a specific edge case' bridges both perspectives and "
            "produces a criterion that is simultaneously diagnostic "
            "(reveals misconceptions), observable (written artifact), and "
            "domain-specific (tied to algorithmic boundary behavior).\n\n"
            "**Confidence:** 0.71 (novel criterion — not yet validated "
            "with student cohort data)\n\n"
            "**Analogical Transfer Note:** This approach mirrors clinical "
            "diagnostic reasoning — listing candidate failure modes, "
            "ordering discriminating tests, and ruling out hypotheses — "
            "applied to programming assessment."
