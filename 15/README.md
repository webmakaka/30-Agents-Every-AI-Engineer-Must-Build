# Chapter 15: Education and Knowledge Agents

**Book:** *30 Agents Every AI Engineer Must Build* by Imran Ahmad (Packt Publishing, 2026)

---

## Overview

This repository is the executable companion to **Chapter 15** of *30 Agents Every AI Engineer Must Build*. It implements two agent architectures that apply the cognitive loop to teaching and collective reasoning: the Education Intelligence Agent (POMDP-based adaptive tutor with probabilistic mastery estimates, zone-of-proximal-development curriculum planning, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, SM-2 spaced repetition, and two-stage misconception detection) and the Collective Intelligence Agent (multi-agent collaboration with role-specialized agents performing propose/critique/synthesize through weighted consensus with adversarial critic rotation and cross-pollination).

Every code cell runs **without an API key** in Simulation Mode, powered by a `MockLLM` engine with a 9-key section-mapped response registry. When an API key is provided (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google) or Ollama is running locally, the notebook seamlessly switches to Live Mode. Each provider has its own pre-executed notebook variant.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build.git
cd ./30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build/
cd chapter15

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then add your provider's dependencies:
pip install -r requirements-openai.txt    # For OpenAI GPT-4o
pip install -r requirements-claude.txt    # For Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4
pip install -r requirements-gemini.txt    # For Google Gemini Flash 2.5
pip install -r requirements-ollama.txt    # For local Ollama (DeepSeek V2)

# 4. (Optional) Configure your LLM provider for Live Mode
cp .env.template .env
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or GOOGLE_API_KEY — or use Ollama locally

# 5. Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook chapter15_education_and_knowledge_agents.ipynb
```

| **13** | Summary | Key takeaways and further reading |

## Real-World Use Case: LearnPath EdTech

What does it take to raise course completion from 52% to 78% across 12,000 learners? The companion case study follows **LearnPath** — an adaptive Python programming platform — as they deploy IRT placement testing (4 minutes vs. 3 weeks of fixed curriculum), Bayesian Knowledge Tracing that detects declining mastery after 2 failures, misconception-targeted feedback that tells students *why* their break statement is wrong, and SM-2 spaced repetition that prevents skill decay over 6 weeks.

Read the full case study: **[USECASE.md](USECASE.md)** — includes student "Jake" Thompson's learning trajectory, the multi-agent rubric design demo, and revenue retention analysis.

## Simulation Mode

When no API key is detected, the notebook activates **Simulation Mode**:

- `MockLLM` replaces the LLM client transparently (works identically across all providers)
- Pre-authored, section-mapped mock responses are educationally accurate
- All mathematical models (BKT, IRT, SM-2) run full computation using pure math
- Consensus protocol runs all rounds with mock proposals
- Every cell executes successfully with no external dependencies

API key detection follows a three-tier cascade: `.env` file → environment variable → interactive prompt → Simulation Mode.

## Pre-Executed Notebook Variants

Every notebook is pre-executed with outputs saved. Pick the variant that matches your setup:

| Notebook | Provider | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION.ipynb](ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION.ipynb) | Simulation | No API key — MockLLM responses |
| [ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_OPENAI_GPT4o.ipynb](ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_OPENAI_GPT4o.ipynb) | OpenAI GPT-4o | Live LLM via `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| [ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_CLAUDE_Sonnet4.ipynb](ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_CLAUDE_Sonnet4.ipynb) | Claude Sonnet 4 | Live LLM via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| [ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_GEMINI_Flash25.ipynb](ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_GEMINI_Flash25.ipynb) | Gemini Flash 2.5 | Live LLM via `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| [ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B.ipynb](ch15_education_and_knowledge_agents__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B.ipynb) | Local Ollama | DeepSeek V2 16B — no API key |

All variants produce equivalent output. Compare them to see how different providers handle the same agent tasks.

For local LLM setup instructions (Ollama + DeepSeek on Windows, macOS, and Linux), see **[LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md](LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md)**.

For a detailed comparison of how each provider performs on this chapter's tasks — including Bloom's taxonomy ratings, strengths/weaknesses, and per-dimension scores — see **[LLM_COMPARISON.md](LLM_COMPARISON.md)**.

## Resilience Architecture

All agent operations are wrapped in the `@graceful_fallback` decorator:

- **On success:** `[INFO]` (blue) → `[SUCCESS]` (green)
- **On failure:** `[INFO]` (blue) → `[HANDLED ERROR]` (red) → fallback value returned
- **Guarantee:** No cell in the notebook will ever raise an unhandled exception

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.10+ (tested up to 3.12)
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt` (base) and `requirements-<provider>.txt` for your LLM provider (includes `openai`, `numpy`, `networkx`, `python-dotenv`)
- **API Key:** Optional — any of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local Ollama. Simulation Mode works without any.
